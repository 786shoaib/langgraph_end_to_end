Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",

The effect reflects a principle that after training an LLM to satisfy a desired property (friendliness, honesty), it becomes easier to elicit a response that exhibits the opposite property (aggression, deception). The effect has important implications for efforts to implement features such as ethical frameworks, as such steps may inadvertently facilitate antithetical model behavior.\n",

It is an artificial neural network that is used in natural language processing by machines. It is based on the transformer deep learning architecture, pre-trained on large data sets of unlabeled text, and able to generate novel human-like content. As of 2023, most LLMs had these characteristics and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.\n",
      "The first GPT was introduced in 2018 by OpenAI. OpenAI has released significant GPT foundation models that have been sequentially numbered, to comprise its \"GPT-n\" series. Each of these was significantly more capable than the previous, due to increased size (number of trainable parameters) and training. The most recent of these, GPT-4o, was released in May 2024. Such models have been the basis for their more task-specific GPT systems, including models fine-tuned for instruction following—which in turn power the ChatGPT chatbot service.\n",
      "The term \"GPT\" is also used in the names and descriptions of such models developed by others. For example, other GPT foundation models include a series of models created by EleutherAI, and seven models created by Cerebras in 2023. Companies in different industries have developed task-specific GPTs in their respective fields, such as Salesforce's \"EinsteinGPT\" (for CRM) and Bloomberg's \"BloombergGPT\" (for finance).\u001b[0m\n",
